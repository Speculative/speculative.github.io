# Introduction

In early 2020, VTubers rapidly began to rise in popularity. In VTuber culture, hitting certain milestone subscriber counts is cause for celebration.

Aside from storing and retrieving the data set, the app is well-suited to be hosted as a static website.

Hodllive uses Vue served from a CDN, and all of the application logic is contained in a single JS file. "Deploying" new versions of the app is as simple as committing and pushing to GitHub.

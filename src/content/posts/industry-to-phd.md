title: Industry to PhD
---

# Introduction

People ask me all the time why I left the industry after working for 5 years as a software engineer
to do a PhD in computer science. I oftentimes find myself retelling this story to prospective PhD
students. I've set it down in writing so that I can refine the story, distill the lessons, and share
it more easily.

## Disclaimer

This is _my own personal experience_. I cannot tell you if you should quit your job to pursue a PhD.
I cannot tell you exactly how to get accepted into a PhD program. I cannot tell you how to have a
successful career in research. I _hope_ that by telling you why and how _I_ did it, I might help you
decide whether you want to do it. I only have one person's worth of experiences, and others have
probably had experiences different from mine. Treat this as one data point among many, and
definitely seek out other opinions.

## Takeaways at a Glance

- I left the industry because I didn't think I could get a job to investigate the things that I
  found interesting.
- I took a big pay cut and my work-life balance is worse.
- I find my work more gratifying and interesting.
- This path is not for everyone, but it was the right choice for me and it might be for you.

# Why Did I Leave The Industry?

# Pros and Cons

I'll start with the downsides that I experienced because they're a lot clearer.

- I have less income. This can't be understated. I make _much_ less as a PhD student and you can
  expect this to be true for you, too, if you currently work a software job. I'm not currently sure
  if my lifetime earning potential is higher or lower. I can afford this because I worked for a few
  years and saved up a lot of money, so I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but if you are in a
  less secure financial situation and you can work as a software engineer, I cannot recommand doing
  a PhD.
- My work-life balance tipped heavily in favor of work. When working in the industry, I got to take
  nights and weekends off without thinking about work at all, whereas as a PhD student I'm sort of
  always working.
  - This varies by field and advisor. My impression is that I have it a bit easier than a lot of
    other PhD students.
  - This also varies based on where you currently are in a project's lifecycle. I work a lot more at
    certain stages (running studies, writing papers) while other times are closer to a regular job
    (implementation).
  - I experience a constant feeling of guilt that pervades all of the non-work things that I do. I
    could technically always be doing more work; it's up to me to choose not to work.
- In ~5 years, you will have to decide on your future again, and this will be every bit as stressful
  as when you were trying to find a job out of undergrad, if not more so.

The upsides are more nebulous:

- The work is more intrinsically interesting because I have a lot more say in picking projects.

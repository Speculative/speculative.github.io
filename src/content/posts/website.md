# Intro

I made a new website! Writing a blog post about the technical details of your new website, promising
to post more, and later making a follow up post apologizing for not posting more is a classic trope
in the tradition of personal websites.

# Tech

This new website is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) using the
[`adapter-static` configuration](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters#supported-environments-static-sites).
Svelte-augmented markdown content is provided by [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/).

# Old Websites

Some day, I'll want this, so here are pictures of the last two websites. The first was based on a
layout that I made for a high school club website many years ago. The second was made some time
during my undergrad days to showcase hackathon projects and had a colored header and footer inspired
by the classic red "Hello My Name Is" nametag.

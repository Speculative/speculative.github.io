In my spare time, I also maintain some side projects:

- [Hodllive](https://www.speculative.tech/hodllive)
  [[source](https://github.com/Speculative/hodllive), [writeup](/posts/hodllive)]: a self-updating
  plot of VTuber subscriber and viewership counts over time. To my knowledge, this is also the most
  complete publicly-accessible dataset of historical VTuber subscriber counts.
- [Holocraft](https://www.speculative.tech/holocraft)
  [[source](https://github.com/Speculative/holocraft), [writeup](/posts/holocraft)]: an interface
  for discovering and viewing clips of Hololive Minecraft streams
- [Purist-Rebel](https://www.speculative.tech/purist-rebel/)
  [[source](https://github.com/Speculative/purist-rebel)]: an interface for making
  ["Purist-Rebel" alignment charts](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1285606-alignment-charts).

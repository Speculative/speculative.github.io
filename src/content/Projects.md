In my spare time, I also maintain some side projects:

- [Hodllive](/hodllive) [[source](https://github.com/Speculative/hodllive), [writeup](/blog/hodllive)]: a self-updating plot of VTuber subscriber counts over time. To my knowledge, this is also the most complete publicly-accessible dataset of historical VTuber subscriber counts.
- [Holocraft](/holocraft) [[source](https://github.com/Speculative/holocraft), [writeup](/blog/holocraft)]: an interface for discovering and viewing translated clips of Hololive Minecraft streams

**Hi, I'm Jeff!** I'm currently an MS Thesis student at **Columbia University**
where I work on **systems to support data interfaces**, advised by Professor [Eugene Wu](https://eugenewu.net).
I'm applying for PhD programs for Fall 2023.

I'm interested in researching:

- How creating interfaces can be made easier
- How interfaces can improve the process of programming
- How non-programmer users can be empowered to take advantage of computing.

In a past life, I worked as a senior full-stack software engineer at MongoDB and
Microsoft.

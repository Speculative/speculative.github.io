**Hi, I'm Jeff!** I'm currently a second-year PhD student at the **University of Pennsylvania**
where I'm advised by Professors [Andrew Head](https://andrewhead.info/) and
[Ryan Marcus](https://rmarcus.info/).

Previously, I was an MS Thesis student at Columbia University where I worked on systems to support
data visualization interfaces, advised by Professor [Eugene Wu](https://eugenewu.net).

In a past life, I worked as a senior full-stack software engineer at MongoDB and Microsoft.

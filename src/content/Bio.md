**Hi, I'm Jeff!** I'm currently a first year PhD student at the **University of Pennsylvania**.

Previously, I was an MS Thesis student at Columbia University where I worked on systems to support
data visualization interfaces, advised by Professor [Eugene Wu](https://eugenewu.net).

I'm interested in researching:

- How creating user interfaces can be made easier
- How interfaces and visualizations can improve the process of programming
- How non-programmer users can be empowered to take advantage of computing

In a past life, I worked as a senior full-stack software engineer at MongoDB and Microsoft.
